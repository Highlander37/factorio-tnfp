Version: 0.4.0
Date: 2019-06-06
  Changes:
    - Add the TNfP Rail Tool (SHIFT+ALT+P or shortcut).  This is a selection tool which
      can create temporary train stops anywhere on the map:
      - Allows the player to request a TNfP train when they're not near a train stop.
      - Allows the player to send their current train anywhere they want from the map
        view.
      As with all train stops, only north-south or east-west rails are valid and
      the rail must be unsignalled.
    - Allow TNfP requests when on a non-TNfP train.  This means the station select can
      now be used for pocket trains, or 'borrowed' trains.
    - Pressing the input shortcut again (ALT-P) now cancels the request.
    - Draw a line from the player to the station we're dispatching to so its clearer
      where to go.  Can be turned off via mod setting.
    - Minor icon update.
    - Allow the station select to be triggered on trains with no schedule.
    - Significant refactoring to support the TNfP Rail Tool.

Version: 0.3.0
Date: 2019-06-01
  Changes:
    - TNfP is now beta rather than experimental.
    - Add support for requesting a train when already on a TNfP train which will then
      skip straight to redispatching.
    - Improve validity and error checking, particularly around driving state, stations
      and train statuses.
    - Initial multiplayer support.  We will now periodically clear requests for trains
      and players that become invalid, as well as avoid double dispatching trains or
      trains with passengers.
    - Add some additional log messages to make errors and completion clearer.

Version: 0.2.0
Date: 2019-05-30
  Changes:
    - Omit temporary stations when copying schedules, as they don't copy correctly
    - Remove arrival behaviour, as boarding timeout is now applied as a wait
      condition.
    - Handle stations we are dispatching to becoming invalid.
    - Improve redispatching for an onward journey so the default waitcondition is
      the passenger is no longer present.  We also now complete correctly if the player
      gets off the train.
    - Add handling of trains switched to manual mode when they're not moving.
