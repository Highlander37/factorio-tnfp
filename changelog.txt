Version: 0.7.0
Date: 2019-11-25
  Changes:
    - Add 'TNfP Home Station' virtual signal.  Stations with this signal will be pinned at the
      very top of the Station Select dialog, above normal pinned stations
    - Pressing enter to submit the search field in the Station Select dialog will now dispatch
      to the first station in the list [Github PR from coderanger]
    - Fix the closest train detection logic when dispatching [Github PR from coderanger]
    - Provide candidate rails to closest train detection logic for temporary stations
    - Allow manual mode shortcut to apply to trains that have just arrived after dispatch
    - Block TSM requester stations from dispatch to avoid breaking the TSM train counter
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.6.0
Date: 2019-11-08
  Changes:
    - Add the ability to pin stations to the top of the 'All Stations' view
    - Add a configurable keyboard shortcut for setting the current train to manual mode
    - Add a configurable keyboard shortcut for providing a railtool and opening the map
    - Right clicking the station selects search bar will now clear the search field
    - Rework the station select gui so its more compact and cleaner
    - Rework the logic when a player boards/disembarks a train:
      - Exiting a train after it arrives at an onward destination is now treated the same as
        exiting whilst on the way
      - Add a special handler so if a trains onward destination is already in its schedule and its
        a tnfp managed train, it will just follow that wait condition and will not resume its
        previous schedule
      - Split completion messages so its clearer what a train will do next
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.5.1
Date: 2019-10-07
  Changes:
    - Add a mod setting to control the default view in the station select dialog
    - Amend dispatch logic so the train arriving at a different station than the one it expects
      but with the same name is handled gracefully
    - Fix localisation of mod setting dropdowns
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.5.0
Date: 2019-09-29
  Changes:
    - Add a search field to the Station Select dialog to filter the list of stations with a mod
      setting to automatically focus it.
    - Add a button to the Station Select dialog to open the map with a railtool in hand
    - The railtool will now automatically close the map and clear the cursor on success
    - Make the station select dialog use localised text strings
    - Updated railtool icon
    - Replace stdlib dependency with standard util.table.deepcopy()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.4.3
Date: 2019-07-31
  Changes:
    - Fix an error since 0.17.59 with assigning an empty train schedule using an empty
      hash instead of nil.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.4.2
Date: 2019-07-17
  Changes:
    - Fix a multiplayer desync issue and improve state management
    - Fix an error in multiplayer with the stationselect
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.4.1
Date: 2019-07-12
  Changes:
    - Add explicit support for LTN train stops, permitting dispatch to any LTN stop
      that is not a depot.  LTN Depots are ignored due to them rescheduling trains.
    - Add explicit support for TSM train stops, permitting dispatch to requester stops.
      TSM supplier stops are ignored due to them rescheduling trains.
    - Add general support for other modded train stops, with a configuration option to
      control whether these are treated 'safely' and ignored or dispatched to.
    - Fix a crash when using the railtool a second time over a temporary station.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.4.0
Date: 2019-06-06
  Changes:
    - Add the TNfP Rail Tool (SHIFT+ALT+P or shortcut).  This is a selection tool which
      can create temporary train stops anywhere on the map:
      - Allows the player to request a TNfP train when they're not near a train stop.
      - Allows the player to send their current train anywhere they want from the map
        view.
      As with all train stops, only north-south or east-west rails are valid and
      the rail must be unsignalled.
    - Allow TNfP requests when on a non-TNfP train.  This means the station select can
      now be used for pocket trains, or 'borrowed' trains.
    - Pressing the input shortcut again (ALT-P) now cancels the request.
    - Draw a line from the player to the station we're dispatching to so its clearer
      where to go.  Can be turned off via mod setting.
    - Minor icon update.
    - Allow the station select to be triggered on trains with no schedule.
    - Significant refactoring to support the TNfP Rail Tool.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.0
Date: 2019-06-01
  Changes:
    - TNfP is now beta rather than experimental.
    - Add support for requesting a train when already on a TNfP train which will then
      skip straight to redispatching.
    - Improve validity and error checking, particularly around driving state, stations
      and train statuses.
    - Initial multiplayer support.  We will now periodically clear requests for trains
      and players that become invalid, as well as avoid double dispatching trains or
      trains with passengers.
    - Add some additional log messages to make errors and completion clearer.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.0
Date: 2019-05-30
  Changes:
    - Omit temporary stations when copying schedules, as they don't copy correctly
    - Remove arrival behaviour, as boarding timeout is now applied as a wait
      condition.
    - Handle stations we are dispatching to becoming invalid.
    - Improve redispatching for an onward journey so the default waitcondition is
      the passenger is no longer present.  We also now complete correctly if the player
      gets off the train.
    - Add handling of trains switched to manual mode when they're not moving.
