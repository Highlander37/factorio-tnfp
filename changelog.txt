Version: 0.3.0
Date: 2019-06-01
  Changes:
    - TNfP is now beta rather than experimental.
    - Add support for requesting a train when already on a TNfP train which will then skip straight
      to redispatching.
    - Improve validity and error checking, particularly around driving state, stations and train
      statuses.
    - Initial multiplayer support.  We will now periodically clear requests for trains and players
      that become invalid, as well as avoid double dispatching trains or trains with passengers.
    - Add some additional log messages to make errors and completion clearer.

Version: 0.2.0
Date: 2019-05-30
  Changes:
    - Omit temporary stations when copying schedules, as they don't copy correctly
    - Remove arrival behaviour, as boarding timeout is now applied as a wait condition.
    - Handle stations we are dispatching to becoming invalid.
    - Improve redispatching for an onward journey so the default waitcondition is the passenger
      is no longer present.  We also now complete correctly if the player gets off the train.
    - Add handling of trains switched to manual mode when they're not moving.
