  Changes:
    - Omit temporary stations when copying schedules, as they don't copy correctly
    - Remove arrival behaviour, as boarding timeout is now applied as a wait condition.
    - Handle stations we are dispatching to becoming invalid.
    - Improve redispatching for an onward journey so the default waitcondition is the passenger
      is no longer present.  We also now complete correctly if the player gets off the train.
    - Add handling of trains switched to manual mode when they're not moving.
